# Traffic_flow_Prediction_GNN_and_Related_models
This repository represents the baseline GNN and its related models, as GCN, Chebshev, GAT(not consider the time series with 
 multiplying the features in T time slots), GAT2(consider the time series feature of the traffic flow). Both GAT consider 
the multy-heads attention.
